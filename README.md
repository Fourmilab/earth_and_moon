# Fourmilab Earth and Moon

[Fourmilab Earth and Moon](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Earth-and-Moon/18452910)
is a model of the Earth and Moon system for the
[Second Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life) virtual world
which combines high-resolution NASA imagery
of the Earth (with ice, snow, and vegetation based upon the
middle of each month) with calculation of the position of the
Sun as observed from Earth to show the illuminated portion of a
cloudless Earth.

The Moon is shown in its current relative position to the Earth,
with a day and night mask showing the illuminated and dark
portions of the Moon.  The Moon is usually shown much closer to
the Earth than its actual distance in order to fit in typical
display spaces, but if you have a large property (say, 128
metres on a side), you can configure the Moon's distance to be
at the correct scale.  The Moon's near face is oriented with
respect to the Earth accounting for optical librations due to
the eccentricity and inclination of the Moon's orbit.  Imagery
of the Moon is derived from NASA high-resolution images from the
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.

This repository contains all of the software and resources,
including programs in Linden Scripting Language, texture
images, notecards, and development documentation, tools,
and resources used the model and its development.  The actual
model is built within Second Life and these components are
installed within it.  (The model is very simple: just five
"prims", one cone and four spheres, linked together into one
object.)

The
[complete model](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Earth-and-Moon/18452910)
is available for free in the Second Life Marketplace.  This
repository contains everything in the model (except the prims,
which are objects built within Second Life), plus additional
resources for developers who may wish to extend or adapt the
model as they wish.  The model is delivered with "full permissions":
those who obtain it are free to copy, modify, and transfer it to
other users within Second Life.
